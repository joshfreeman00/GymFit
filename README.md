## Design

### Images

The images used throughout the website are relivant to each page they are on.

* The langing image is used to should off the equipment the gym has to offer along with a zooming in animation that draws attention of the user.
* The background image for the classes page someone helping someone else, this is relivant to what the page is about.
* Lastly the background image for the contacts page, although not relivant, its blurred so that the user does not need to pay attention to the image, its purpose is to provide a better design than a dull single colour background.

### Colour scheme

* The use of a blue palette within this theme provides a non-threatening feel for the user and provides tranquility too.

### Fonts 

* Fredoka font is the main font used throughout the website and features rounded edges on the text. A fullback font of Sans-Serif is used just in case for whatever the reason is that the font isnt loaded correctly.

The link to this font is found [here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka?query=fredoka)

* Rubik is used for the logo of the web page that is more rounded and thicker than Fredoka, this makes it stand out amongst the rest of the text. This provides User Clarity allowing the user to easily spot the websites title. A fullback font of Sans-Serif is used just in case for whatever the reason is that the font isnt loaded correctly.
