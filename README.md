## Design
### Images
### Colour scheme
* The use of blue within this theme provides a non-threatening feel for the user and provides tranquility too.
<!-- !Preview(Color theme goes here)  -->
### Fonts
* Fredoka font is the main font used throughout the website and features rounded edges on the text. A fullback font of Sans-Serif is used just in case for whatever the reason is that the font isnt loaded correctly.
* Rubik is used for the logo of the web page that is more rounded and thicker than Fredoka, this makes it stand out amongst the rest of the text. This provides User Clarity allowing the user to easily spot the websites title. A fullback font of Sans-Serif is used just in case for whatever the reason is that the font isnt loaded correctly.

The use of rounded is used for a casual theme, making the user feel at home.

## Testing

### Bugs
* A display property with the value 'inline-block' (ln 27 col 5) was conflicting with the float property, this was fixed by deleting the display property and the corresponding value.
* The hero image on the home page has been cut off at the top. This was fixed by replacing the 'center' value with 'top'. The image was later was changed for better user clarity.
* the active nav menu and when hovering over said menu, the bottom border sits too far below the text. this was fixed by adding the a 'nav' selector including the 'translate' property containing the value of '0, 1em'
